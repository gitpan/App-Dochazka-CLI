DESCRIPTION
    This is the Dochazka command line client.

COMMANDS
    The command syntax is intended to be closely coupled with the underlying
    REST resources.

  Top-level resources
    The top-level REST resources are documented at
    App::Dochazka::REST::Dispatch.

    `GET'
    A lone `GET' (equivalent to `GET HELP') is analogous to sending a bare
    GET request to the base URI.

    `GET HELP'
    The same as sending a GET request for the 'help' resource.

    `GET COOKIE'
    This command dumps the cookie jar. It is client-side only, so no
    analogous REST resource.

    `GET EMPLOYEE'
    The same as sending a GET request for the 'employee' resource.

    `GET EMPLOYEE CURRENT'
    The same as sending a GET request for the 'employee/current' resource.

    `GET EMPLOYEE [INTEGER]'
    The same as sending a GET request for the 'employee/[INTEGER]' resource.
    For example, `GET EMPLOYEE 1' should retrieve the profile of the
    employee 'root'.

    `GET EMPLOYEE [STRING]'
    The same as sending a GET request for the 'employee/[STRING]' resource,
    where [STRING] is an alphanumeric string. For example, `GET EMPLOYEE
    root' should retrieve the profile of the employee 'root'.

    `GET WHOAMI'
    The same as sending a GET request for the 'whoami' resource.
